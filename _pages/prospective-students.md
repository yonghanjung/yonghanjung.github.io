## **Welcome to the Causal Data Science Lab!**

Our lab is built on one principle: **causal inference is our central mission.** We are curiosity-driven and inspired by problems that emerge from real-world, practical settings. To thrive here, you must bring a deep passion for causality itself, along with the discipline and resilience to pursue it through steady, rigorous work. We hold ourselves to high standards of clarity, rigor, and professionalism, and we believe that growth comes through frequent and direct feedback. We are always looking for students whose excitement about causality matches our own and who are eager to contribute to a collaborative causal inference community that pushes the frontier forward.

### Who We Are

We are the **Causal Data Science Lab**, dedicated to advancing the theory and practice of causal inference. Our goal is to develop rigorous theoretical frameworks and computational methods that uncover causal relations and answer fundamental “why” and “what-if” questions using statistical and computational tools.

Our current research agenda is organized around five main pillars:

1. **Identification and Estimation under Real-World Imperfections** — advancing frameworks that reliably infer causal effects despite challenges such as unmeasured confounding, limited overlap, or complex data-generating processes.
2. **Robust and Scalable Estimation** — designing variance-stable, computationally efficient methods that scale to high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.
3. **Trustworthy Inference** — developing methods to ensure transparent, reliable, fair, and interpretable inference in high-stakes scientific and societal settings.
4. **Causal Decision-Making** — creating algorithms that leverage causal reasoning to support efficient, robust, and generalizable decision making in complex, high-stakes environments.
5. **Causal AI for Diverse Modalities** — integrating causal reasoning with modern AI to enhance trustworthy causal inference methods, enabling richer analyses of images, text, temporal data, and other complex modalities.

### How We Work

**Our Rhythm: Discipline and Consistency**

Success in research does not come from irregular bursts of effort. It emerges from _steady, sustainable, disciplined, and focused work over time_. This is not about watching the clock; it is about sustaining momentum and building habits that support long-term excellence. Synchronizing with daylight hours is not only healthy but also makes collaboration smoother and more effective. Just as private companies expect a standard 9-to-5 commitment, I expect the same baseline professionalism for research.

**Our Focus: Causal Inference First**

Our sole mission is to advance causal inference itself. While we employ tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Generative AI when they serve this goal, they are not the main focus of our work. Applicants should be able to articulate a genuine, intrinsic curiosity about causality itself—not simply an interest in applying AI techniques to fashionable domains.

**Our Standards and Commitments**

- _Shared Success —_ A student’s success is my success. I am committed to investing in your growth and helping you become an independent researcher in the causal inference community.
- _High Standards_ — Success is not only about technical excellence. It largely depends on the rigor of our methods, the depth of our analysis, the professionalism of our communication, and the kindness we show one another. We aim for excellence in all these dimensions.
- _PhD is Earned_ — A PhD is not awarded for time served, but for demonstrating the ability to conduct independent, impactful research that advances causal data science. It is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, and I am committed to helping you reach that bar.

**Our Mindset**

A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint. Success in this lab requires cultivating a mindset that supports long-term growth and strong relationships with your advisor and colleagues:

- _Respectful Professionalism_ — Treating others with professionalism and respectfulness is essential for building lasting relationships and thriving in research. Our lab grows when we support one another, and cultivating these qualities can be one of the most important foundations of long-term success.
- _Discipline and Dedication_ — Treat your research as a top priority. Consistency, engagement, and focus are the foundation of success in research.
- _Mental Resilience_ — Research inevitably brings setbacks, disagreements, rejections, and failed experiments. The key is to maintain steady momentum and sustained motivation, keeping your energy focused on learning from challenges rather than being derailed by them.
- _Coachability_ — Growth requires not only accepting straightforward and frequent feedback, but also actively seeking it, reflecting on it, and implementing it quickly.
- _Proactivity and Ownership_ — You are the driver of your research. Take ownership of projects, set agendas, report progress, and explore new directions without waiting for instructions.
- _Growth Beyond Technical Skills_ — A PhD is an apprenticeship in becoming a professional researcher. Technical expertise is only part of success; communication, critical evaluation, and professional conduct are equally important.

### Who We Are Looking For

**A Genuine Passion for Causal Inference**

As emphasized in _Our Focus: Causal Inference First_, we seek colleagues who have a genuine passion and deep curiosity about causal inference itself. The ideal candidate can clearly articulate why causality excites them and why they want to dedicate their PhD journey to advancing this field.

**Strong Foundations in Math and Statistics**

Our work is grounded in mathematical formality and statistical rigor. You should be comfortable with statistical inference and mathematical analysis. If your background is still developing in these areas, you must have a proactive willingness to strengthen it early in your program and embrace learning new technical skills without hesitation.

**A Mindset for Growth**

Pursuing a PhD is fundamentally about growth—becoming a professional and independent researcher. An ideal candidate will already embody the qualities described in _Our Mindset_, and show a strong commitment to cultivating them throughout their training.
