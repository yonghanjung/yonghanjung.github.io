I am Yonghan Jung, an assistant professor in the School of Information Science at the UIUC and the leader of the **Causal Data Science Lab**. My research focuses on developing causal data science methods to understand causal effects in complex, imperfect data, with broad applications in trustworthy AI and healthcare science. Our primary research areas include:

1. **Identification and Estimation under Real-World Imperfections** — advancing frameworks that reliably infer causal effects despite challenges such as unmeasured confounding, limited overlap, or complex data-generating processes.
2. **Robust and Scalable Estimation** — designing variance-stable, computationally efficient methods that scale to high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.
3. **Trustworthy Inference** — developing methods to ensure transparent, reliable, fair, and interpretable inference in high-stakes scientific and societal settings.
4. **Causal Decision-Making** — creating algorithms that leverage causal reasoning to support efficient, robust, and generalizable decision making in complex, high-stakes environments.
5. **Causal AI for Diverse Modalities** — integrating causal reasoning with modern AI to enhance trustworthy causal inference methods, enabling richer analyses of images, text, temporal data, and other complex modalities.
