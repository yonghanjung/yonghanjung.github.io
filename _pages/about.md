I am Yonghan Jung, an assistant professor in the School of Information Science at the UIUC and the leader of the **Causal Data Science Lab**. My research focuses on developing causal data science methods to understand causal effects in complex, imperfect data, with broad applications in trustworthy AI and healthcare science. Our primary research areas include:

1. **Identification and estimation under real-world imperfections** - advancing frameworks that reliably infer causal effects despite unmeasured confounding, limited overlap, or complex data-generating processes.
2. **Robust and scalable estimation** — designing variance-stable, computationally efficient methods for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets.
3. **Causal decision making** — developing high-stakes, trustworthy decision-making algorithms by leveraging the causal mechanisms underlying complex systems.
4. **Causal AI for diverse modalities** — integrating causal reasoning with deep learning to enhance trustworthy causal inference methods, enabling better analysis of images, text, temporal data, and other rich data types.
