I am Yonghan Jung, an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences at the UIUC and the leader of the **Causal Data Science Lab**.

My research advances causal inference methodology through three core areas that address the challenges of real-world data complexity, computational scalability, and actionable decision support:

1. **Pragmatic Causal Inference:** Advancing causal inference methods that address real-world challenges such as unmeasured confounding, limited overlap, and complex data-generating processes.

2. **Scalable Causal Inference:** Designing computationally efficient and statistically robust methods that scale to high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

3. **Causal Decision Making:** Creating algorithms that leverage causal reasoning to support robust and safe decision making in complex, high-stakes environments.

<!-- - **Identification and Estimation under Real-World Imperfections** — advancing frameworks that reliably infer causal effects despite challenges such as unmeasured confounding, limited overlap, or complex data-generating processes.
- **Robust and Scalable Estimation** — designing variance-stable, computationally efficient methods that scale to high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.
- **Trustworthy Inference** — developing methods to ensure transparent, reliable, fair, and interpretable inference in high-stakes scientific and societal settings.
- **Causal Decision-Making** — creating algorithms that leverage causal reasoning to support efficient, robust, and generalizable decision making in complex, high-stakes environments.
- **Causal AI for Diverse Modalities** — integrating causal reasoning with modern AI to enhance trustworthy causal inference methods, enabling richer analyses of images, text, temporal data, and other complex modalities. -->
