I am Yonghan Jung, an assistant professor in the School of Information Science and a leader of the **Causal Data Science Lab** at UIUC. I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue University and was a member of the <a href='https://causalai.net/'>Causal Artificial Intelligence Lab</a> (director: Elias Bareinboim) at Columbia University. I am working on causal data science and its application to trustworthy AI and healthcare science.

The **Causal Data Science Lab** addresses the full spectrum of causal inference, from foundational theory to real-world applications. Our primary research interests include:

1. Developing causal effect estimation frameworks in diverse and practical scenarios.
2. Adapting causal inference methods to handle complex data modalities.
3. Advancing trustworthy AI through causal reasoning.
4. Designing causal agents for end-to-end inference and decision-making.
