## Welcome!

I am recruiting _PhD students_ for **Spring 2025 (for current UIUC students)** or **Fall 2026 class** in general. If you want to join our lab, please apply to the UIUC School of Information Science. Important information regarding this can be found [here](https://ischool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/phd-information-sciences/apply). If you are a UIUC student, feel free to email me about getting involved. This website will give you a sense of some projects in our lab.

Our lab aims to address the full spectrum of causal inference, from foundational theory to real-world applications. Our primary research interests include:

1. Developing causal effect estimation frameworks in diverse and practical scenarios.
2. Adapting causal inference methods to handle complex data modalities.
3. Advancing trustworthy AI through causal reasoning.
4. Designing causal agents for end-to-end inference and decision-making.
