      abstract={Identifying and measuring biases associated with sensitive attributes is a crucial consideration in healthcare to prevent treatment disparities. One prominent issue is inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, which tend to overestimate oxygen saturation for dark-skinned patients and misrepresent supplemental oxygen needs. Most existing research has revealed statistical disparities linking device errors to patient outcomes in intensive care units (ICUs) without causal formalization. In contrast, this study causally investigates how racial discrepancies in oximetry measurements affect invasive ventilation in ICU settings. We employ a causal inference-based approach using path-specific effects to isolate the impact of bias by race on clinical decision-making. To estimate these effects, we leverage a doubly robust estimator, propose its self-normalized variant for improved sample efficiency, and provide novel finite-sample guarantees. Our methodology is validated on semi-synthetic data and applied to two large real-world health datasets: MIMIC-IV and eICU. Contrary to prior work, our analysis reveals minimal impact of racial discrepancies on invasive ventilation rates. However, path-specific effects mediated by oxygen saturation disparity are more pronounced on ventilation duration, and the severity differs by dataset. Our work provides a novel and practical pipeline for investigating potential disparities in the ICU and, more crucially, highlights the necessity of causal methods to robustly assess fairness in decision-making.},

  abstract={Learning robust models under distribution shifts between training and test datasets is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While learning invariant features across environments is a popular approach, it often assumes that these features are fully observed in both training and test sets-a condition frequently violated in practice. When models rely on invariant features absent in the test set, their robustness in new environments can deteriorate. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel learning principle called the Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL) framework, which focuses on learning a sufficient subset of invariant features rather than relying on a single feature. After demonstrating the limitation of existing invariant learning methods, we propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), to learn diverse invariant features by seeking common flat minima across the environments. We theoretically demonstrate that finding a common flat minima enables robust predictions based on diverse invariant features. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, including our new benchmark, confirm ASGDRO's robustness against distribution shifts, highlighting the limitations of existing methods.}

  abstract={Artificial intelligence systems are trained combining various observational and experimental datasets from different source sites, and are increasingly used to reason about the effectiveness of candidate policies. One common assumption in this context is that the data in source and target sites (where the candidate policy is due to be deployed) come from the same distribution. This assumption is often violated in practice, causing challenges for generalization, transportability, or external validity. Despite recent advances for determining the identifiability of the effectiveness of policies in a target domain, there are still challenges for the accurate estimation of effects from finite samples. In this paper, we develop novel graphical criteria and estimators for evaluating the effectiveness of policies (e.g., conditional, stochastic) by combining data from multiple experimental studies. Asymptotic error analysis of our estimators provides fast convergence guarantee. We empirically verified the robustness of estimators through simulations.},

  abstract={Covariate adjustment, also known as back-door adjustment, is a fundamental tool in causal inference. Although a sound and complete graphical identification criterion, known as adjustment criterion (Shpitser et al., 2010), exists for static contexts, sequential contexts present challenges. Current practices, such as the sequential back-door adjustment (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or multi-outcome sequential backdoor adjustment (Jung et al., 2020), are sound but incomplete; i.e., there are graphical scenarios where the causal effect is expressible via covariate adjustment, yet these criteria do not cover. In this paper, we exemplify this incompleteness and then present the sequential adjustment criterion, a sound and complete criterion for sequential covariate adjustment. We provide a constructive sequential adjustment criterion that identifies a set that satisfies the sequential adjustment criterion if and only if the causal effect can be expressed as a sequential covariate adjustment. Finally, we present an algorithm for identifying a minimal sequential covariate adjustment set, which optimizes efficiency by ensuring that no unnecessary vertices are included.},
