  abstract={Learning robust models under distribution shifts between training and test datasets is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While learning invariant features across environments is a popular approach, it often assumes that these features are fully observed in both training and test sets-a condition frequently violated in practice. When models rely on invariant features absent in the test set, their robustness in new environments can deteriorate. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel learning principle called the Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL) framework, which focuses on learning a sufficient subset of invariant features rather than relying on a single feature. After demonstrating the limitation of existing invariant learning methods, we propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), to learn diverse invariant features by seeking common flat minima across the environments. We theoretically demonstrate that finding a common flat minima enables robust predictions based on diverse invariant features. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, including our new benchmark, confirm ASGDRO's robustness against distribution shifts, highlighting the limitations of existing methods.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
